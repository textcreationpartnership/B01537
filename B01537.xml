            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Unto His Majeſties High Commiſſioner, and the Right Honourable Eſtates of Parliament.</head>
            <head>THE PETITION OF JAMES BAYNE His Majeſties Late Mr. Wright.</head>
            <opener>Humbly Sheweth,</opener>
            <p>THAT when King <hi>Charles</hi> the ſecond of Bleſſed Memory Reſolved to build a Palace in this his Ancient Kingdom, for the better reception of Himſelf and Succeſſors, when ever they ſhould Honour the Nation with their preſence. His Majeſtie gave Commiſſion to your Petitioner to be Maſter Wright, which office he diſcharged with great Fidelitie; And having at the time of Building the Palace at Holyrood-houſe, and reparations of the <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles</hi> of <hi>Edinburgh, Stirling,</hi> &amp; <hi>Baſs</hi> an opulent Fortune of about 50000 Pounds <hi>Scots</hi> worth of timber in the Buſs of <hi>Leith,</hi> as is well known to many of this Citie, and could be made appear by Irrefrageble inſtructions, ſuch was his zeal for the publict, &amp; earneſt deſire to carry on theſe works which were to the Honour and ſecurity of the Kingdom, that when there was not Money in the Theaſurie to buy matterials neceſſary; He furniſhed all things ſo far as that his Stock could reach. And more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, he raiſed Money owing him be ſome Noble Perſons, and Others, <hi>Viz:</hi> from the Marqueſs of <hi>Tweddal,</hi> his Majeſties Commiſſioner, 7000 pounds, from the Earl of <hi>Panmure</hi> 12000 pounds, and from the Earl of <hi>Strathmore</hi> 4000 pounds, and from the Neighbours in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> ten thouſand pounds, in all 33000 pounds, which was raiſed in the year 1675, and the Annualrent thereof ſince that time, would more then double the Summ, and even after that all was exhauſted, he ingadged his Credit, and ceaſed not to furniſh what was needful, till that the Palace was compleated; But by theſe means he not only ſpent his own Fortune, but ſtands conſiderably in debt to others, he being never as yet reimburſed by his Majeſtie of the ſumms given out by him, and his caſe and condition being repreſented to the late King <hi>James,</hi> his Majeſtie was Graciouſly pleaſed to Recommend to the Lords of Theaſurie to conſider your Petitioners claim and accompts; And the Marqueſs of <hi>Tweddal,</hi> now his Majeſties High Commiſſioner, <hi>the Lord Balcarras,</hi> and General <hi>Drummond</hi> being appointed by the Theaſurie to viſit his compts, their Lordſhips at that time adjuſted for upwards of two thouſand pound Sterling by ſubſcribed compts, beſides two thouſand and five hundred pounds more of Money foreſaid, which theſe noble perſons did not then fully conſider; And report of this being made to to the Lords of the Theaſurie, they granted your Petitioner a preceipt for five hundred pounds Sterling: But the Revolution and change in Government hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening ſhortly thereafter, he got no payment thereof, as the precept herewith produced does evidence, ſo that there is yet more nor four thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pound Sterling owing be the publict to him, beſides the Annualrent thereof; By which he is reduced to moſt miſerable ſtraits, a moſt ſad and lamentable condition, and more deploreable than he can expreſs, and which can hardly be conceived by any but by him who feels its ſaid preſſure: For now ſome of his Creditors are in poſſeſſion of his Lands within this City, yielding about eight hundred pound <hi>Scots</hi> yearly: And others having perſonal diligence againſt
<pb facs="tcp:175131:2"/>him, have frequently incarſerate and impriſoned him, &amp; being liberate only upon his friends, being Caution to preſent him again to Priſon when required, he is ſtill in danger of being apprehended by Meſſingers at the inſtance or other Creditors; By all which he is not only put out of all Trade and imployment, and has nothing wherewith to maintain himſelf and prevent <hi>Starving,</hi> nor can he any wayes ſatisfie his Juſt Debts and relieve his Friends, which is no little Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to an Honeſt and ingenuous Spirit; Eſpecially conſidering, That your pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioner is owing much, amongſt others, to Widdows and Orphans, who In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted him with their whole Stock, and are thereby now reduced to Beggary; And ſince all this Miſerie is come upon him by his Zeal for advancing Works to the Honour and Safetie of the Nation, and by his being obliedged to pay Annualrent for 27500 pound <hi>Scots,</hi> which he contracted by carrying on theſe puBlick Works as is evident by a general Suſpenſion herewith produced, which he obtained againſt his Creditors, and to which no regard is had, and by his lying out of more then 4500 pound <hi>Starling</hi> and Annualrents thereof owing him be the Publict, of which the Lords of Theaſurie are moſt ſenſible, and after frequent Supplications declare their willingneſs to do your petitioner Juſtice, but alleadge they have not a Fond for ſatisfying him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>IT is therefore humbly Craved, That Your Grace, and Honourable Eſtates of Parliament, would take Your Petitioners ſad Caſe, and Circumſtances to your ſerious Conſideration, And in regard to Juſtice &amp; Honour of the Nation, Ordain ſome Fond for paying your Petitioner the</hi> 2000 <hi>pound</hi> Starling <hi>and more already ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted, the Compts whereof are Subſcrived, and the</hi> 2500 <hi>pound Money foreſaid juſtly Reſting, tho not yet fully Adjuſted, Together with the Annualrent of both the Summs, ſince the time they became due; and if all cannot be ſhortly payed, that in the mean time he may have ſome Money advanced for his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent miantainace, and the Lords of Seſſion be authorized to grant him Suſpenſion againſt his Riged Creditors upon his giving aſſignation to what is owing by the Publict to him for their more ready payment, That ſo your Petitioner may have wherewith to pay his juſt Debts, And what is more nor ſatisfies his Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, he may have it to maintain him in his Old Age, That no Tradeſ-man hereafter may be diſcouradged to advance publict Works, when they ſhall ſee and hear how the Honourable Court of Parlament concern themſelves to ſee the Publicts juſt Debts Satisfied and Payed.</hi> And Your Petitioner ſhall ever Pray, &amp;c.</p>
